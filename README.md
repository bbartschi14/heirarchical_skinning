# heirarchical_skinning
OpenGL project for constructing tree-driven hierarchical skeleton modeling and skinning.

- Skeleton vs. Mesh view
- Skeletal subspace deformation 
- Per vertex normal calculations for smooth shading

Created for MIT course 6.837.

## Running the program

`heirarchical_skinning.exe` can be run in the terminal with one command line parameters that defines the model asset to be used. For example, to run with `Model1`, execute `./heirarchical_skinning.exe Model1`. Make sure to have the `assets` folder in the same directory.

## Features

The character model can be controlled by both the sliders in the GUI and by selecting joints in the viewport and using the rotation gizmo.
